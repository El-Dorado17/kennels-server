#There are the two modules to study for now .It's the intro

#command to start a virtual env. ensures libraries and everything aren't
#in the whole OS, they're just local to this project:

#pipenv shell

#Bottom of animal request module shows some hard-coded animals,
#but the actual goal is to have them in the SQLite table

#used sqlite open database to open and view the sql table but I can't remember
#how to do it from, scratch


# Models are templates of what the data should have/look like
# views are where we get the specific info needed
# and req handler is where we outline what to do with the requests (get, psot, etc)
